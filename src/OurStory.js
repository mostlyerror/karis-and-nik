        Our story begins in July 2017 when Karis, after having thought about it
        for a while, finally made her profile on Coffee Meets Bagel, an online
        dating app. Little did she know that only days earlier, Nik, after some
        prompting by a few wise friends, had updated his own profile with new
        pictures and description. One day as Nik was going through his daily
        Bagels, he saw Karis’ profile pop up. He would have to pay to connect
        unless he thought that the app would automatically match them later
        down the road, but nothing was guaranteed. Nik couldn’t pass up the
        opportunity and decided to match. Karis, who still felt very new to
        online dating, saw Nik pop up as a bagel in her account, noticed that
        he wanted to connect with her, and decided this was worth consulting
        her go-to relationship experts: her siblings. She took a screenshot of
        Nik’s profile and sent it to the sibling committee. They gave her a
        thumbs up, and so Karis and Nik connected. They started texting back
        and forth, first about BBQ in Texas and then about their respective
        work and home states. Eventually, they decided to meet. Nik suggested
        Kata Robata because it’s a good restaurant and would be a good gauge on
        whether Karis could weather Nik’s favorite food: sushi. Karis
        cautiously agreed, excited about trying a new restaurant and meeting a
        new person but unsure what to expect if she wasn’t interested. Nik was
        excited and comfortable meeting someone new because he had been on
        several failed dates.

        When Karis and Nik finally met in person, they enjoyed dinner and good
        conversation together. When Karis got home, she debriefed with her
        parents about how she thought the date went, and Nik quickly followed
        up with a clever text that made both her and her dad laugh. Nik knew he
        wanted to see her again because of the ease of conversation between the
        both of them and the common interests they shared. From there, Karis
        and Nik continued to text and go on dates, which led to the occasional
        phone calls, and eventually a conversation about their relationship.
        They decided to make it official, and in October 2017, they went on
        their (second) first date!

        For the next year and a half, Karis and Nik had tons of fun dating.
        They enjoyed cycling along the Houston bayous, playing flag football,
        cheering on their respective basketball teams, traveling to visit
        friends and attend weddings, and exploring Houston’s museums,
        restaurants, and dessert shops. Throughout their dating, they shared a
        common interest in escape room games with friends and family. This gave
        Nik the idea to have an escape room at his house for Karis to go
        through with hints and clues about their experiences and relationship.
        Nik knew that he had a small window to propose before Karis would be
        too stressed out with preparing for her dissertation defense. He
        planned the escape room in his house and, under the guise of an already
        scheduled date night, asked Karis to come over after she was done in
        the lab. Karis, feeling a bit stressed that her dissertation defense
        was in less than three weeks, rushed to his place from the lab. While
        she was still driving over, Nik texted her the beginning of her mission
        to save the universe from the dreadful Thanos by finding the stolen
        Infinity Stone hidden in Nik’s house. Karis went through each puzzle
        leading her to the Infinity Stone (an actual rock) and to the keys of
        her escape car. As the garage door opened, Nik greeted her on her
        success on getting the Infinity Stone only to inform her that she had
        gotten the wrong stone. Karis looked at Nik with confusion with this
        news as he knelt on one knee to present her the real stone she had been
        searching for. With an enthusiastic yes, Nik had finally reached his
        endgame and the universe was saved!
