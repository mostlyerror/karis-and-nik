One day as Nik was going through his daily Bagels, he saw Karis\u2019 profile pop up. He would have to pay to connect unless he thought that the app would automatically match them later down the road, but nothing was guaranteed. Nik couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity and decided to match. Karis, who still felt very new to online dating, saw Nik pop up as a bagel in her account, noticed that he wanted to connect with her, and decided this was worth consulting her go-to relationship experts: her siblings. She took a screenshot of Nik\u2019s profile and sent it to the sibling committee. They gave her a thumbs up, and so Karis and Nik connected. They started texting back and forth, first about BBQ in Texas and then about their respective work and home states. Eventually, they decided to meet. Nik suggested Kata Robata because it\u2019s a good restaurant and would be a good gauge on whether Karis could weather Nik\u2019s favorite food: sushi. Karis cautiously agreed, excited about trying a new restaurant and meeting a new person but unsure what to expect if she wasn\u2019t interested. Nik was excited and comfortable meeting someone new because he had been on several failed dates."),o.a.createElement("p",null,"When Karis and Nik finally met in person, they enjoyed dinner and good conversation together. When Karis got home, she debriefed with her parents about how she thought the date went, and Nik quickly followed up with a clever text that made both her and her dad laugh. Nik knew he wanted to see her again because of the ease of conversation between the both of them and the common interests they shared. From there, Karis and Nik continued to text and go on dates, which led to the occasional phone calls, and eventually a conversation about their relationship. They decided to make it official, and in October 2017, they went on their (second) first date!"),o.a.createElement("p",null,"For the next year and a half, Karis and Nik had tons of fun dating. They enjoyed cycling along the Houston bayous, playing flag football, cheering on their respective basketball teams, traveling to visit friends and attend weddings, and exploring Houston\u2019s museums, restaurants, and dessert shops. Throughout their dating, they shared a common interest in escape room games with friends and family. This gave Nik the idea to have an escape room at his house for Karis to go through with hints and clues about their experiences and relationship. Nik knew that he had a small window to propose before Karis would be too stressed out with preparing for her dissertation defense. He planned the escape room in his house and, under the guise of an already scheduled date night, asked Karis to come over after she was done in the lab. Karis, feeling a bit stressed that her dissertation defense was in less than three weeks, rushed to his place from the lab. While she was still driving over, Nik texted her the beginning of her mission to save the universe from the dreadful Thanos by finding the stolen Infinity Stone hidden in Nik\u2019s house. Karis went through each puzzle leading her to the Infinity Stone (an actual rock) and to the keys of her escape car. As the garage door opened, Nik greeted her on her success on getting the Infinity Stone only to inform her that she had gotten the wrong stone. Karis looked at Nik with confusion with this news as he knelt on one knee to present her the real stone she had been searching for. With an enthusiastic yes, Nik had finally reached his endgame and the universe was saved!"))};a(13);var l=function(){return o.a.createElement("section",{className:"Rsvp"},o.a.createElement("h1",null,"RSVP!"))};a(14);var d=function(){return o.a.createElement("section",{className:"TheDayOf container"},o.a.createElement("h1",null,"TheDayOf"),o.a.createElement("ul",{className:"details"},o.a.createElement("li",null,"Saturday The Twenty-Sixth of October"),o.a.createElement("li",null,"Two Thousand and Nineteen"),o.a.createElement("li",null,"Houston, TX")))};var c=function(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"App"},o.a.createElement(s,null),o.a.createElement(d,null),o.a.createElement(h,null),o.a.createElement(l,null))};Boolean("localhost"===window.location.hostname||"[::1]"===window.location.hostname||window.location.hostname.match(/^127(?:\.(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)){3}$/));r.a.render(o.a.createElement(c,null),document.getElementById("root")),"serviceWorker"in navigator&&navigator.serviceWorker.ready.then(function(e){e.unregister()})}],[[3,1,2]]]);
